## Usage

Using the Calls & SMS Viewer is incredibly simple. You don't need any special softwareâ€”just a modern web browser.

### Step 1: Get the Viewer

Since this app is a single HTML file, you can get it in two ways:

1.  **Directly from GitHub Pages:** Access the live version of the app hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://shashotonur.github.io/calls-sms-viewer/).
2.  **Download the Code:** Clone the repository or download the `index.html` file to your computer.

### Step 2: Open the Viewer

If you downloaded the file, open it by double-clicking it or by dragging it into your web browser window.

### Step 3: Load Your Data

In the top-left corner, you'll see two buttons represented by an SVG icon for messages  and another for a phone .

  * Click the **message icon** to select your SMS backup file.
  * Click the **phone icon** to select your call log backup file.

The viewer will automatically parse the data, merge it, and display your conversations. You can load files in any order; the application will handle the merging in the background.

## Required XML File Structures

This application is designed to work with XML backup files created by popular Android apps. Your files must adhere to one of the following structures:

### SMS File Structure (`<sms>` tags)

Each message should be represented by an `<sms>` tag with the following attributes:

  * `address`: The phone number of the contact.
  * `date`: The Unix timestamp of the message.
  * `type`: The type of message (e.g., `1` for received, `2` for sent).
  * `body`: The content of the message.
  * `readable_date`: The human-readable date and time.
  * `contact_name`: The name of the contact, if available.

### Call Log File Structure (`<call>` tags)

Each call should be represented by a `<call>` tag with these attributes:

  * `number`: The phone number of the contact.
  * `duration`: The duration of the call in seconds.
  * `date`: The Unix timestamp of the call.
  * `type`: The type of call (e.g., `1` for incoming, `2` for outgoing, `3` for missed, `5` for rejected).
  * `readable_date`: The human-readable date and time.
  * `contact_name`: The name of the contact, if available.
